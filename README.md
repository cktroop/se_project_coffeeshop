# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

After completing this project, i'd like to customize the website to reflect a different coffee shop name "The Croak and Brew", potentially using a custom cursor and other fun elements I would like to add as a personal project!
